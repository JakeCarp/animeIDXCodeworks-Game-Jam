<h1>Anime Idaho × Boise Codeworks Game Jam</h1>

<p>Welcome to the official repository for the Anime Idaho × Boise Codeworks Game Jam! Whether you're a coding bootcamp grad, an anime convention regular, or somewhere in between—this jam is for you. The goal? Foster creativity, build community, sharpen game dev skills, and above all—have fun!</p>

<h2>Key Info</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jam Starts:</strong> April 18, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> Midnight on April 28, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theme: <strong>DRAW YOUR FATE</strong></h2>
<p>This year's theme draws inspiration from the world of Tarot—mystery, fate, choices, and transformation. But don’t worry: you don’t need to make a tarot game. You can interpret this theme however you like!</p>

<h2>Design Prompts (optional inspiration):</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fate vs. Choice</strong> – Does the player choose their destiny, or are they pulled along by forces beyond their control?</li>
  <li><strong>The Cards You’re Dealt</strong> – Randomness or procedurally generated challenges can represent the unpredictability of fate.</li>
  <li><strong>Major Arcana, Major Themes</strong> – Each tarot card (e.g., The Fool, Death, The Tower, The Lovers) holds rich symbolism. You could base a mechanic, level, character, or story twist around one.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycles & Transformation</strong> – Life-death-rebirth loops, character growth, time mechanics, or gameplay that shifts based on player decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Divination</strong> – Mystical, eerie, or mysterious settings, characters who see the future, or mechanics that "read" the player’s choices.</li>
  <li><strong>Literal Cards</strong> – Maybe cards are gameplay elements! Deck builders, power-up draws, or mini-game mechanics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Genre is up to you!</h2>
<p>Your game can be <strong>any genre</strong>—platformer, roguelike, puzzle, rhythm game, sim, visual novel, horror, comedy, etc. You don’t have to include literal tarot cards. You don’t even have to mention fate—just take the idea of “Draw Your Fate” and run with it in your own direction.</p>
